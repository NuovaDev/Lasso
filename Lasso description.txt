[h3] Created for the Unique Assists Fraymakers workshop contest. [/h3]

Tie up the opponent and yank them back after every hit! Lasso isnâ€™t just a normal hitting assist, but a tool that can make insane combos that would never normally be possible, or help with neutral for a brawler who needs to keep the foe close. When you hit the enemy with Lasso he tethers them to you for a while, not letting them get away. This can also benefit opponents as well because it IS just pulling them to you, so be careful. After a bit of fighting Lasso will get too tired and snap loose, giving one more good pull as he goes. In conclusion Lasso is just a cute lil guy.
